How do I add a TreeView Control?
--------------------------------

Unity lacks a built-in TreeView control so I've created a skinable control for those bleeding for one.

You can manipulate the tree view in code or by using the TreeView inspector tool.


To add a TreeView control select an existing game object and use the Menu (TreeView) and select the menu

item (Add Tree View to Selected). With the inspector, you can add items with the IDE and move them around.


You can manually drop the TreeViewControl.cs script onto an existing GameObject.


You can also drag and drop the Example.cs script on to your TreeView control. The example programatically

adds items to the tree view control.


TreeViewItems can be added via the TreeViewControl.Items property, through the TreeViewControl.RootItem,

or by using the TreeViewItem.AddItem method.


I hope you find this control a real time saver. You can send comments/questions to tim@tagenigma.com and please
